# Power BI Automated Weekly Reporting

This project was built as part of a senior capstone course (CIS 4980) at Georgia State University in partnership with Evergreen, an Insight Global division. The goal was to replace a manual Excel-based weekly summary process with a streamlined and automated Power BI dashboard supported by Power Automate workflows.

## 🧠 Project Objective

The main objective was to improve Evergreen's weekly team reporting workflow by:
- Reducing manual Excel work.
- Enhancing visibility into weekly employee highlights, goals, and concerns.
- Automating data refreshes and reducing human error.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop** – for interactive dashboard development
- **Microsoft Excel** – as the source data form for employee inputs
- **Power Automate** – for automating data collection and refresh workflows
- **SharePoint & OneDrive** – for file storage and refresh connectivity

## 📋 Project Deliverables

- An interactive **Power BI Dashboard** summarizing weekly employee data.
- A fully functional **Excel input form** used by employees to submit updates.
- An **automated workflow** that syncs form data to Power BI using Power Automate.
- A demonstration **video walkthrough** of the solution.

## 📂 Included Files

- `Weekly Report Summary.pbix` – Final Power BI dashboard file  
- `Weekly Report.xlsx` – Structured Excel form for employee data entry  
- `Weekly Report Summary.pdf` – PDF version of the dashboard
